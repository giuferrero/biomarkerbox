This section will perform a correlation analysis between the sample covariates providing:

* The results of a Pearson correlation analysis between sample covariates
* The results of a Spearman correlation analysis between sample covariates
* A graphical representation of the correlation results.

The following report files will be generated:

* 2b_Correlation_plot.html
* 2b_Correlation_plot.pdf
* 2b_Correlation_plot.tex

All the report files will be generated in the folder **0_Analysis_Reports**

The following output files will be generated:

* Correlation_Table_Attributes_Pearson_correlation_all.txt
* Correlation_Table_Attributes_Pearson_correlation_significant.txt
* Correlation_Table_Attributes_Spearman_correlation_all.txt
* Correlation_Table_Attributes_Spearman_correlation_significant.txt
* Correlation_Plot_Corrplot_Pearson_correlation.pdf
* Correlation_Plot_Corrplot_Spearman_correlation.pdf
* Correlation_Plot_Scatterplot_cov1_cov2.pdf - cov1 and cov2 are the compared covariates

All the output files will be generated in the folder **02_Attribute_Analysis**
