This section will perform a PCA analysis of the input data providing:

* A table and a screeplot reporting the importance of each identified principal component
* A PCA plot colored based on a selected covariate

The following report files will be generated:

* 3b_PCA_by_covariates.html
* 3b_PCA_by_covariates.pdf
* 3b_PCA_by_covariates.tex

All the report files will be generated in the folder **0_Analysis_Reports**

The following output files will be generated:

* PCA_Table_PC_count_data_importance.txt
* PCA_Plot_Count_data_screeplot.pdf
* PCA_Plot_PCA_count_Data_colored_by_attribute id.pdf - Attribute id = attribute used for the analysis

All the output files will be generated in the folder **02_Attribute_Analysis**
